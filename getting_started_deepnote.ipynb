If you haven't already, take the time to read the [Deepnote Docs](https://docs.deepnote.com/), it really isn't long or complicated!\n\n##### 2. Create a **Deepnote Project** called ```python_project_template```. \n\n##### 3. Join their **Slack Channel**!\n\n+ **Note** that you can access the **command palette** and various other **resources** via the **icons** on the **bottom left** of your project **sidebar** e.g. ***link to join their slack channel***.\n\n##### 4. To create a template that is Github friendly, we'll want to include some of ther usual repo suspects e.g. ***Gitignore***, ***Readme***, ***Contributing Guide*** (and ***LICENCE*** if applicable).\n\n### Readme\n> Below is a template for a good basic Readme. Please use it. Also see the [```Readme```](./Readme.md) to this project which is written off the template below. Even if you don't know the full extent of your project, it's good practise to set up a Readme template that you can easily **edit as you progress**. If you are ***only*** going to be working on ***Deepnote***, we'd recommend creating a **```readme.ipynb```** or **```getting_started.ipynb```** as an ***alternative*** to what the ```Readme``` is for your Github projects.\n\n```markdown\n## Project Title\n\n> Sub-Heading (Small Description)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n> Place a more detailed description of your project, how it came about, inspiration, reading. \n\n### ```Story```\n\n> User Story for your project. Decribe what you solutions does, in a brief step by step story.\n\n### ```Dependencies```\n\n> Instructions for installing project dependencies (packages the project will depend on).\n\n### ```Running```\n\n> Instructions for running the solution.\n\n## Contributing\n\n> Instructions for contributing to the project. See [contributing.md](./contributing.md)\n```\n\n> If you want to provide some **contribution guidelines**, create a **```contributing.md```** file within the root of your project. Check out our **sample [```contributing.md```](./contributing.md)** file.\n\n### Gitignore\n> Ignoring ```.deepnote``` folder/files and ```init.ipynb``` file.\n\n##### We reccommend simply including [Github's Python Gitignore Template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore). As we'll be building our template with the deepnote project root as our actual project root, we're going to add a couple files within our deepnote environment that we don't need version controlled.\n\n```\n# Deepnote files\n.deepnote/\ninit.ipynb\n```\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-ddeea107-1f6c-4c9d-9127-5d6ad43809d7","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dependencies\n> Dealing with project dependencies (packages the project will depend on)\n\nHandling Python project **dependencies** (packages, python version etc) locally is ***virtually*** the same on Deepnote. One difference is that Deepnote already has it's own dependencies pre-installed, meaning we don't have to install commonly used packages like ```pandas```. See [```init.ipynb```](./init.ipynb) for more info. \n\n#### ```requirements.txt```\n\nIt's good practice to track the dependencies of our projects ourselves via a ```requirements.txt``` file or ```Pipfile```. The [Documentation](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/python-requirements) suggests using ```pip``` and a ```requirements.txt``` file e.g.\n\n![deepnotePip](https://mcusercontent.com/c977a94491aefa0b53bca6f72/images/798ac624-85a6-43c7-a7e7-1ce794be3924.gif)\n\n### ```Pipfile```\n\nWe can alternatively use **```pipenv```** by replacing some code in ```init.ipynb``` to deal with ```pipenv``` and ```Pipfile``` instead of ```pip``` and ```requirements.txt```. e.g.\n\n```bash\n%%bash\n# If your project has a 'Pipfile' file, we'll install it here apart from blacklisted packages that interfere with Deepnote (see above).\nif test -f Pipfile\n  then\n    sed -i '/jedi/d;/jupyter/d;' Pipfile\n    pip install pipenv\n    pipenv install --skip-lock\n  else \n    pip install pipenv\n    pipenv install --skip-lock\nfi\n```\n\n**Note:** We are using ```--skip-lock``` to tell ```pipenv``` not to create a ```Pipfile.lock```. This is because we are not building a long term project and don't want to increase project load times.\n\n### ```Dockerfile```\n> Read more about **custom environments** and the **Dockerfile** in the [documentation](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/custom-environments).\n\nInstalling dependencies via ```pip``` during your projects initialisation phase can increase the time it takes to load your projects after a restart. An alternative way of dealing with our environment dependencies in Deepnote is via the ```Dockerfile``` e.g. we can ***build*** an environment with ```chromium-driver``` pre-installed like so:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM ..\nRUN sudo apt-get update\nRUN pip install chromium-driver -y\n```","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-d2b77e95-c91d-4081-9cdb-6defec2b0137","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Customisation\n> Example of cusomisation via ```bash``` and ```init.ipynb```.

Duplicating the project will also copy over any customisations to ```Dockerfile``` and ```init.ipynb```. e.g.\n\n##### 1. Open your project template on Deepnote and hover/click the ***project title*** (in the ***header***).\n\n##### 2. Click the ```Duplicate project``` button to create a new project from your template. If you want to ***edit*** the Dockerfile, it's best to revert back to default, then build a new one.\n\n##### 3. To get version controlling, create a new (empty) Github repo, copy it's ***ssh*** and link it via your new project's Github integration. **Move the ```.git``` folder** (and any additional files e.g. LICENCE) **into your project root** and **delete the cloned folder**.\n\n##### ***Tip:*** You can create additional Deepnote projects, based off this template, that will relate to different solutions. E.g. you could have a project template called ```Web Scraping Template``` that will have additional default packages or configurations that relate specifically to web scraping (e.g. ```nerodia```, ```lxml```, ```chromium-driver```).\n\n##### ***Note:*** See this [EPL Web Scraper](https://deepnote.com/project/19f51d7b-ae79-4c51-906c-dee0138da144) project as an example.
