Deepnote already has it's own dependencies pre-installed but it's good practice to track the dependencies of our own projects ourselves (so our projects can be used outside of Deepnote). The [Documentation](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/python-requirements) suggests using ```pip``` and a ```requirements.txt``` file (which you are free to do), however we can also use ```pipenv```. For this we'll need to create our own code in ```init.ipynb``` to deal with ```pipenv``` and ```Pipfile``` instead of ```pip``` and ```requirements.txt```. **Follow steps below to use ```pipenv``` to manage dependencies**.\n\n##### 1. On Open Terminal and install ```pipenv``` with ```pip```\n\n```bash\n$ pip install pipenv\n```\n\n##### 2. Run ```pipenv install```\n\n```\n$ pipenv install\nCourtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project. You can set PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS=1 to force pipenv to ignore that environment and create its own instead. You can set PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1 to suppress this warning.\nCreating a Pipfile for this project…\nPipfile.lock not found, creating…\nLocking [dev-packages] dependencies…\nLocking [packages] dependencies…\nUpdated Pipfile.lock (a65489)!\nInstalling dependencies from Pipfile.lock (a65489)…\n  🐍   ▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉ 0/0 — 00:00:00\n```\n\n**Note**: ```pipenv``` identifies that you are already working within a virtual environment (as you would locally with ```pipenv```). So simply creates a ```Pipfile``` and ```Pipfile.lock``` without initialising another virtual environment.\n\n##### 3. Customise Deepnote ```init.ipynb``` to install ```pipenv``` and project dependencies in ```Pipfile```. You'll already see the code block for ```pip``` and ```requirements.txt``` there. We can just **replace this code block** with ours (which will also deal with deleting ```jupyter``` or ```jedi``` packages from Pipfile):\n\n```bash\n%%bash\n# If your project has a 'Pipfile' file, we'll install it here apart from blacklisted packages that interfere with Deepnote (see above).\nif test -f Pipfile\n  then\n    sed -i '/jedi/d;/jupyter/d;' ./Pipfile\n    pip install pipenv\n    pipenv install\n  else echo \"There's no Pipfile, so nothing to install. This is the case with most projects.\"\nfi\n```\n\n**Note**: You can now ***install*** all other possible dependecies you may need for your project via the **Terminal** e.g. ```pipenv install pandas```. If you restart your machine, deepnote will run the ```init.ipynb``` file to install all you're project dependencies automatically via ```pipenv```.\n\n**Note**: **As per the warning in ```init.py``` do not install the packages ```jedi``` or ```jupyter```**. If you are using ```.ipynb``` files however, make sure you make ***note*** ```jupyter``` down as a project dependency on your project **Readme**.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-d2b77e95-c91d-4081-9cdb-6defec2b0137","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample Python Program\n\n> Sample Project to Test Dependency Management. The script will use Pandas to fetch and parse HTML tables from Power10 website and output the number of tables found.\n\n##### 1. As we know we're using Pandas, so install ```pandas``` via ```pipenv```. Open Terminal: \n\n```bash\n$ pipenv install pandas\n```\n\n##### 2. **Copy** code below into a code cell (create a notebook if you don't have one in your project yet) and ***Run*** the code cell.\n\n```python\nimport pandas\n\nurl = \"https://www.thepowerof10.info/rankings/rankinglist.aspx?event=100&agegroup=ALL&sex=W&year=2020\"\n\ndfs = pandas.read_html(url)\n\nlen(dfs)\n```\n\n##### 3. You'll notice an error, if you scroll down, you'll see it's a missing package called ```lxml```. Install ```lxml``` via ```pipenv```:\n\n```bash\n$ pipenv install lxml\n```\n\n##### 4. Restart the notebook and re-run the code cell.\n\n**Note**: Remove dependencies with ```pipenv uninstall``` e.g. ```pipenv uninstall lxml```.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-7af6f849-bb27-49d7-b8d2-9a12f2013780","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Readme \n> Below is a template for a good basic Readme.
