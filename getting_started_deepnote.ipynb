One difference is that Deepnote already has it's own dependencies pre-installed, meaning we don't have to install commonly used packages like ```pandas```. However, it's good practice to track the dependencies of our projects ourselves (so our projects can be used outside of Deepnote? or so we can lock in package versions with ```pipenv``` on long term projects?). The [Documentation](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/python-requirements) suggests using ```pip``` and a ```requirements.txt``` file, **which you are free to do**, however we can also use **```pipenv```**. To do this we'll need to replace some code in ```init.ipynb``` to deal with ```pipenv``` and ```Pipfile``` instead of ```pip``` and ```requirements.txt```. **Follow steps below to use ```pipenv``` to manage dependencies**:\n\n##### 1. Simply customise ```init.ipynb``` file (Environment Tab) to install ```pipenv``` and project dependencies in ```Pipfile```. You'll already see the code cell for ```pip``` and ```requirements.txt``` there. We can just **replace the code in this code cell with ours** (which will also deal with deleting ```jupyter``` or ```jedi``` packages from Pipfile):\n\n```bash\n%%bash\n# If your project has a 'Pipfile' file, we'll install it here apart from blacklisted packages that interfere with Deepnote (see above).\nif test -f Pipfile\n  then\n    sed -i '/jedi/d;/jupyter/d;' Pipfile\n    pip install pipenv\n    pipenv install --skip-lock\n  else \n    pip install pipenv\n    pipenv install --skip-lock\nfi\n```\n\n**Note:** We are using ```--skip-lock``` to tell ```pipenv``` not to create a ```Pipfile.lock```. This is because we are not building a long term project and don't want to increase project load times.\n\n##### 2. Now you can install pacakges via ```pipenv``` in your project teminals e.g. ```pandas```:\n\n```bash\n$ pipenv install pandas --skip-lock\n```\n\n**Note**: **As per the warning in ```init.py``` do not install the packages ```jedi``` or ```jupyter```**. If you are using ```.ipynb``` files and would like to give your projects the oppertunity run locally (e.g. in jupyter notebook/lab), make sure you make a ***note*** of ```jupyter``` being a project dependency on your project **Readme** (or add ```jupyter = \"*\"``` to your version controlled ```Pipfile```).\n\n##### 3a. Installing dependencies via ```pip``` during your projects initialisation phase can significantly increase the time it takes to load your projects after a restart (e.g. ```pip install pipenv``` in ```init.ipynb```). An alternative way of dealing with this in Deepnote is via the ```Dockerfile```. Read more about [custom environments here](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/custom-environments). e.g. In the **```Dockerfile```** (Environment Tab), we can create an environment with ```pipenv``` pre-installed like so:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM ..\nRUN sudo apt-get update\nRUN pip install pipenv\n```\n\n##### 3b. Hit ```Run build``` or ```Build``` and Deepnote will create a chached image of this custom environment (which will include ```pipenv``` by default). **Restart the machine when promt to do so**. This simple step will have cut our project's load time significantly! Remember to remove the ```pip install pipenv``` commands from your projects ```init.ipynb``` notebook.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-d2b77e95-c91d-4081-9cdb-6defec2b0137","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample Python Program\n\n> Sample Project to Test Dependency Management. The script will use Pandas to fetch and parse HTML tables from Power10 website and output the number of tables found.\n\n##### 1. **Copy** code below into a code cell (create a notebook if you don't have one in your project yet) and ***Run*** the code cell.\n\n```python\nimport pandas\n\nurl = \"https://www.thepowerof10.info/rankings/rankinglist.aspx?event=100&agegroup=ALL&sex=W&year=2020\"\n\ndfs = pandas.read_html(url)\n\nlen(dfs)\n```\n\n##### 2. You'll notice an error, if you scroll down, you'll see it's a missing package called ```lxml```. To install ```lxml``` via ```pipenv```, you can either open a project Terminal and use the CLI (Command Line):\n\n```bash\n$ pipenv install lxml --skip-lock\n```\n\n##### 2. Or, simply add ```lxml``` to the project's ```Pipfile``` and restart the **project machine (Environment Tab)**:\n\n```\n[packages]\npandas = \"*\"\nlxml = \"*\"\n```\n\n##### 3. Restart the notebook and re-run the code cell.  If you get ***unexpected errors*** even after ***installing the new package***, ***restart*** the **project machine (Environment Tab)**.\n\n**Note**: Remove dependencies with ```pipenv uninstall``` e.g. ```pipenv uninstall lxml```.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-7af6f849-bb27-49d7-b8d2-9a12f2013780","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Customisation (Deepnote)\n> Customise your Deepnote experience with ```init.ipynb``` e.g. in another code cell below your dependencies code cell\n\n#### Git Alliases\n\n```bash\n%%bash\ngit config --global alias.st status\ngit config --global alias.ci commit\ngit config --global alias.co checkout\ngit config --global alias.br branch\ngit config --global alias.lg \"log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit\"\n```","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-bd21f6cf-2201-45b4-abdd-f48cf6bdd4bc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Duplicating your Template Project\n> Once you're happy with your Project you can simply duplicate it to use it as a Template.
