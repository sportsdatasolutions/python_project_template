Please use it. Also see the [```Readme```](./Readme.md) to this project which is written off the template below.

Only difference is that Deepnote already has it's own dependencies pre-installed. It's good practice to track the dependencies of our projects ourselves (so our projects can be used outside of Deepnote). The [Documentation](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/python-requirements) suggests using ```pip``` and a ```requirements.txt``` file (which you are free to do), however we can also use ```pipenv```. To do this we'll need to replace some code in ```init.ipynb``` to deal with ```pipenv``` and ```Pipfile``` instead of ```pip``` and ```requirements.txt```. **Follow steps below to use ```pipenv``` to manage dependencies**.\n\n##### 1. Simply customise ```init.ipynb``` file (Environment Tab) to install ```pipenv``` and project dependencies in ```Pipfile```. You'll already see the code cell for ```pip``` and ```requirements.txt``` there. We can just **replace the code in this code cell with ours** (which will also deal with deleting ```jupyter``` or ```jedi``` packages from Pipfile):\n\n```bash\n%%bash\n# Make sure we change into the project directory, if this project is in the root directory comment out the line below.\ncd project_folder # Change project_folder to your actual project folder name!\n# If your project has a 'Pipfile' file, we'll install it here apart from blacklisted packages that interfere with Deepnote (see above).\nif test -f Pipfile\n  then\n    sed -i '/jedi/d;/jupyter/d;' Pipfile\n    pip install pipenv\n    pipenv install\n  else \n    pip install pipenv\n    pipenv install\nfi\n```\n\n##### 2. **Run** the the ***code cell*** or **restart** the ***machine***. The bash script will firstly change directory into your project folder and check if there is a ```Pipfile```. If there is one, it will remove blacklisted packages, install ```pipenv```, and run ```pipenv install```. If not, it will install ```pipenv``` and run ```pipenv install``` to initialise a ```Pipfile``` and ```Pipfile.lock```.\n\n**Note**: If you ***don't*** want to work out of a ***project folder** within Deepnote, you can simply ***drag*** all the files and folders (including ```.git``` folder) into the root of your Deepnote project, and delete the empty project folder. In the ```init.ipynb``` file, simply **comment out** the line that ```cd```s into the 'project folder'. At the same time, as you're now operating in the Deepnote project root, you'll want to **add ```.deepnote``` and ```init.ipynb```** to your **```.gitignore```** file. e.g.\n\n```\n# ignore deepnote stuff (if working in deepnote project root)\n.deepnote\ninit.ipynb\n```\n\n**Do This**: You can now ***install*** all other possible dependecies you may need for your project via the **Terminal** e.g. \n\n  ```bash\n  # if working out of project folder\n  $ cd project_folder\n  $ pipenv install pandas\n  # if working from Deepnote root\n  $ pipenv install pandas\n  ``` \n\n  If you **restart** your ***machine*** (Environment Tab), Deepnote will run the ```init.ipynb``` file to install all you're project dependencies automatically via ```pipenv```.\n\n**Note**: **As per the warning in ```init.py``` do not install the packages ```jedi``` or ```jupyter```**. If you are using ```.ipynb``` files however, make sure you make ***note*** ```jupyter``` down as a project dependency on your project **Readme**.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-d2b77e95-c91d-4081-9cdb-6defec2b0137","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample Python Program\n\n> Sample Project to Test Dependency Management. The script will use Pandas to fetch and parse HTML tables from Power10 website and output the number of tables found.\n\n##### 1. As we know we're using Pandas, so install ```pandas``` via ```pipenv```. Open Terminal, ``cd`` into project folder if working within one: \n\n```bash\n$ pipenv install pandas\n```\n\n##### 2. **Copy** code below into a code cell (create a notebook if you don't have one in your project yet) and ***Run*** the code cell.\n\n```python\nimport pandas\n\nurl = \"https://www.thepowerof10.info/rankings/rankinglist.aspx?event=100&agegroup=ALL&sex=W&year=2020\"\n\ndfs = pandas.read_html(url)\n\nlen(dfs)\n```\n\n##### 3. You'll notice an error, if you scroll down, you'll see it's a missing package called ```lxml```. Install ```lxml``` via ```pipenv```:\n\n```bash\n$ pipenv install lxml\n```\n\n##### 4. Restart the notebook and re-run the code cell.\n\n**Note**: Remove dependencies with ```pipenv uninstall``` e.g. ```pipenv uninstall lxml```.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-7af6f849-bb27-49d7-b8d2-9a12f2013780","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3rd Party Integrations (Deepnote)\n\n> Use the code in [```sample_notebook.ipynb```](./sample_notebook.ipynb) (type it all out, don't copy paste over :P) to test out Deepnote integrations (see Integrations Tab on Deepnote Project).","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00008-2cffb304-b97f-4d2c-8073-452a0139e9c3","output_cleared":false}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.3"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"35c9ecdc-a060-418f-9f83-dde2e2f8733f","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
