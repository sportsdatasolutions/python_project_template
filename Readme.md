## Getting Started

> This setup guide inspired our [Python Project Template](https://github.com/sportsdatasolutions/python_project). If you are coming from there, have a read of our ***getting started*** guides (linked below) to give you more of an ***understanding*** as to how you can ***customise*** your own version of the template.

### See our **[Getting Started Deepnote Guide](./getting_started_deepnote.md)** 
> To create your own ***Deepnote Project Template*** for ***Deepnote Projects***. Launch this tutorial in [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) via the button at [top](#python-project-templates-tutorial-) of this Readme.

### See our **[Getting Started Locally Guide](./getting_started_local.md)** 
> To create your own ***Github Repo*** for ***Python Projects***. You can then setup your resulting Github Repo as a [Github Template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) for future projects!
